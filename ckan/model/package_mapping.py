    # where PackageTag object is created *and* flushed but does not yet have
    # the package_id set (this cause us other problems ...). Some time later a
    # second commit happens in which the package_id is correctly set.
    # However after first commit PackageTag does not have Package and
    # delete-orphan kicks in to remove it!
