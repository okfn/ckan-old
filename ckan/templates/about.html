    <h2>About CKAN</h2>

    <p>CKAN is the Comprehensive Knowledge Archive Network, a <strong>registry</strong> of <a
      href="http://opendefinition.org/">open knowledge</a> packages and projects
    (and a few closed ones). CKAN is the place to search for open knowledge
    resources as well as register your own.</p>

    <p>CKAN's aim is make it easy to <strong>find, share and reuse open
      content and data</strong>, especially in ways that are <strong>machine
      automatable</strong>.
