API Overview
-------------

The CKAN API is separated into three parts:

* `Model API`_
* `Search API`_
* `Form API`_

The CKAN API follows the RESTful (Representational State Transfer)
style. Published resources are separated both from the methods supported by
the resources, and from the data formats and status codes used by the methods.
